## Frontmatter
- Yes the Bambinos can pull good espresso.
- No a 54mm basket isn’t inherently worse. 


## General Information
Portafilter: 54mm
Max Shot Length: 60 Seconds
Pre-Infusion: Yes; seemingly lower pressure; max 10 seconds.
PID: Built-in  with no ability to adjust (Set to 93 Celsius)[^1]
Heating System: "ThermoJet" flat heating element. 3 sec heat up time.
Hot Water Dispenser: Yes (Bambino Plus requires a special button combination)
Pressure: Rated at 9 bars

### Bambino
- Aluminum Portafilter
- Fully articulating Steam wand (ball joint)
- Capable of blooming shots due to the lack of a “3 way valve”[^2]
	- Drips after stopping a shot
	- “Wetter” pucks in theory
### Bambino Plus
The plus has a few additional features listed below:
- Stainless Steel portafilter (heavier and larger thermal mass)
- Milk Autofroth function w/ Auto Purge
	- Results in less free-movement in the wand 
- "3 way valve" that diverts water away from the puck at the end of the shot
	- This prevents blooming style shots of espresso
	- Results in a drier puck and minimal drips when stopping a shot

## General Cleaning

### Cleaning your group-head and Backflushing
If you have a Bambino/Bambino Plus  you should flush your group-head after each shot or set of shots and give it a wipe at the end of your shot(s) and flushing.

If you have the Bambino Plus; you are able to backflush as needed. 

### Descaling
Both machines will remind or require you to run a descaling cycle after a certain number of shots. This can be done using the provided Dezcal solution. The manual should include the recommended mixtures and amounts for each machine.

## Pain-points and Oddities

### Drip Tray
It is small; you are going to have to deal with it. Some folks will use a separate cup to catch drips/purges etc. 

For the Bambino Plus; if you don't keep the sensor clean when using the "AutoMilk" feature; it may have trouble detecting the the temperature of the milk.

### The tamper
It is bad; it doesn't fill the whole width of the basket so you will need to tamp again to get rid of the edges. A new one is recommended; but not absolutely required. 


### Steamwand
Good milk is possible and relatively easy. Its not the most powerful steamwand but very capable of producing good microfoam. The Bambino has a 1-hole steam tip and the Bambino Plus has a 4-hole steam tip.

#### Steaming
You will need to purge before steaming milk due to condensation gathering in the wand. It is plenty powerful and you can get well textured milk.

#### Cleaning
Milk has a tendency to stick to the wand after steaming. You should always wipe after steaming. 

I've found that dairy milk will not come off of a still hot steam wand. I recommend catching some of the water used for flushing the group-head after the shot and using that to wet your towel and to give the wand a good wipe. 

### Descale Reminders
It would appear different version of the Bambino/Bambino Plus have different parameters for cleaning. Some will let you skip the cleaning and some will not. May the odds ever be in your favor

That being said; descale your machine unless you have water that won't scale.

## Potential Pitfalls

### Grinding
It’s not uncommon to have a Bambino sold in stores that don’t offer espresso capable grinders. This can lead to a number of unexpected issues for first time users outlined below:

 - Not having a grinder
	 - You can ask for a recommendation in the EAF discord or read the wiki. Since grinders come out what feels like every week; I recommended asking discord. 
 - Grinder doesn’t grind fine enough for espresso
	 - You can try pulling turbos
	 - You can use the pressurized baskets that came with your machine. You may have to coarsen your grind. 
 - The difference between grind settings is too great
	 - You’ll notice this happening when you change your grind by 1 setting and it goes from gushing to choking. But ask. 
 



## Dialing In intricacies 
With a 54mm portafilter; you will likely be grinding coarser as compared to a 58mm when considering the same kind of coffee. This is due to the depth of the puck imparting more resistance compared to a thinner puck of a 58mm.  




## Tips and Tricks 

### Dealing With a Tiny Driptray
You can purge the steam wand into a separate jar/bowl/container so as not to fill the drip tray as rapidly. Bonus is that you can empty a cup or jug a lot easier than the tray. Pro-tip; use something that you don’t have to tilt to remove from under the steam wand. 
### Quick Purge on the Bambino (minus)
You can purge the steam wand by holding down the steam button until the pump engage. This will jet out 3 spurts of water to empty the steam wand.
### The solenoid and steaming on the Bambino (minus)
From Lexycorn in EAF: 
>…Inside the machine the heater has to be switched between the group and steam wand. By starting a shot you are connecting the group to the heater and allowing excess pressure and steam to be purged through the group head instead… 

The method is as follows: 

While steaming you can press the brew button twice somewhat slowly to trigger the brew function. This toggles a solenoid that divers steam/pressure from the wand to the brew group. This stops the steaming immediately. 

CAVEAT IMPEROTOR: This can lead to the wand “Sucking up” milk as its not designed to be switched like that. Make sure you purge to prevent or lessen the risk of this. 

[^1]: People have experimented with adding resistors or potentiometers to adjust the temperature. Not for the faint of heart. 

[^2]: 3 way is in quotes because per a teardown The Bambino minus has a 3 way valve as it routes water/steam from the thermojet to the steam wand or grouphead. The Plus has 4 paths so that it can also route from the grouphead to the drip-tray.
