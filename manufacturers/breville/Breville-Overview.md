## Breville Rundown + History
*from wikipedia*
> **Breville Group Limited** or simply **Breville** is an Australian [multinational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_corporation "Multinational corporation")manufacturer and marketer of [home appliances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_appliance "Home appliance"), headquartered in the inner suburb of [Alexandria, Sydney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria,_Sydney "Alexandria, Sydney"). The company's brands include Breville, Kambrook and [Ronson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronson_(company) "Ronson (company)") (outside of North America). In the UK and Europe the company, firming as Sage Appliances, goes to market as the _Sage_ brand (because the name Breville is taken by the unrelated [Jarden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarden "Jarden") company in the UK) and as the Breville brand in the rest of the world.
> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breville_Group


As of 2022 Breville Group owns Baratza and Lelit.

Per the above, and in general, Sage is the name in the UK/EU whereas Breville in the majority of the world.

## Portafilters et al
- 58 mm
	- "Professional" sized portafilters; can generally fit standard 58 mm accessories
	- 2~eared portafilter is unique to breville. Not compatible with standard[^1]e61 portafilters
		- Ignore product images that show a 3 ear portafilter 
- 54 mm
	- 3-eared portafilter; again is unique to breville. Plenty of accessories available due to the proliferation of breville 54mm machines. 
- 51 mm
	- Generally no longer used by Breville; Duo Temp used it along with other older models.
	- Generally DeLonghi 51mm 3-ear portafilters and accessories work with this size[^2].

[^1]: For whatever a standard an “e61” is. Most e61 portafilters are interchangeable with each other with exceptions. For example LaMarzocco portafilters have slightly different lug sizes and may not take some e61 portafilters.
[^2]: Based on personal experience with an 800esxl and third party and delonghi 3-ear portafilters.
